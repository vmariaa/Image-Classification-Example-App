A simple app that tests and shows a CoreML image classification model.
The purpose of this image classification model was to teach it to differentiate between two very similar types of cats - Jaguars and Leopards. The task was especially hard because of little details that distinguishes those two - such as a head shape or (most of the time) a certain, yet still very similar pattern on their bodies.
The CoreML model used in the app has a success rate of 90%, which is more than satisfactory in this case.

The app allows the user to upload a photo from their gallery and makes a guess at which of the two cats is present in the picture. 

Made in UIKit.
